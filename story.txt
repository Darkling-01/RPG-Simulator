Welcome to the RPG-Sim.

Your character takes place during a time with no light nor the ability to use mordern weapons.
During the search of new dungeons, your character had joined a guild but got wiped out when taking a wrong turn.
Being the only survivor, it is your duty to fight your way out from the dungoen and the creatures that lurk in every corner.
This is just the beginning of an endless cruel dream.

Good Luck!
